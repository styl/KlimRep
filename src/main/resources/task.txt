Design and implement an API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money
transfers between internal accounts/users.
Explicit requirements:
1. Keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is invoked
by another internal system/service)

2. Use whatever frameworks/libraries you like, but don't forget about the requirement. Spring Boot is
preferred.

3. The datastore should run in memory for the sake of this test

4. The final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a preinstalled
container/server)

5. Demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected

6. Scalable, Durable solution â€“ as a plus.

Implicit requirements:
1. The code produced by you is expected to be of good quality.
2. There are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
